                    Behaviour: Dex in one of many cats rescued from a lifetime in extremely 
                    poor conditions. He was saved when we received a call from a household 
                    reporting that he was being abused. He is a sweet but timid boy. 
                    He can also sometimes be anxious. We need someone to show Dex that 
                    the world isn't as scary as it seems!
