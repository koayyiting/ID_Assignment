# Overview of my Project
This is our project which is designed based on a topic given which is "Possible Theme 5: Propose Your own."...

Our Goal is...

## Design Process
My Design Process for this website is to let users...

Example:
- As a user type, I want to press the navigation buttons, so that I am able to navgiate to other pages.

Wireframe Link: 

## Feature

### Existing Features
Example:
- Feature 1 - On the Navigation tab, it allows users to navigate to other page, by having them on click to the navigation button.

### Features Left to Implement
-

## Technologies Used

- [HTML]
- [CSS]
- [JAVASCRIPT]


## Testing

Example:
1. Navigation Tab:
    1. Go to the Navigation Tab
    (Since one page include 2 content, tab buttons need to link to page and page section)
    2. Try to navigate to another page's section

## How my project will looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes

Example:
- When the size is down to width 576px, sizes of different content will strink. Flex-box will also be utilised so the users would still be able to see the informations in the flex-boxes which means the arrangement of the Website will be slightly different from what users can see on thier laptop/computer. 

## Interesting bugs or problems I discovered during my testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet
