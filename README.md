# Overview of Our Project
This is our project which is designed based on a topic given which is "Possible Theme 5: Propose Your own.".We decide to work on a pet adoption website. Why we decided to work on this topic is to help the abandon pets to get a nice place to live in. This website will include Home, Adopt, Donate, Event, Contact Page.

Our Goal is create a interactive and user friendly website.

## Design Process
Our Design Process for this website is to let users to be able to use the website easily. We decided to go for the default fonts size, not too big or small to make the website neater. We will also design our website in a way that our information will be easily understood by the user (eg. Adoption Process). Our project will include navigation tabs to navigate to different pages, some front-end interactivity, organized and well structured information in the pages as well as suitable typography and color schemes. 

Users we also be able to visit our website on their phones. (not sure, if got time)

Example:
- As a user type, I want to press the navigation buttons, so that I am able to navgiate to other pages.

## Feature

### Features Left to Implement
-

## Technologies Used

- [HTML]
- [CSS]
- [JAVASCRIPT]


## Testing

Example:
1. Navigation Tab:
    1. Go to the Navigation Tab
    (Since one page include 2 content, tab buttons need to link to page and page section)
    2. Try to navigate to another page's section

## How my project will looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes

Example:
- When the size is down to width 576px, sizes of different content will strink. Flex-box will also be utilised so the users would still be able to see the informations in the flex-boxes which means the arrangement of the Website will be slightly different from what users can see on thier laptop/computer.
