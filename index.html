                <p>
                    <strong>What is this website about?</strong><br>
                    This Website is made to introduce our lovely cats to Singaporeans. <br>
                    On this website, we will be able to Adopt, Donate and Volunteer!<br><br>
                    <strong>How We Started: </strong><br>
                    We started from volunteering events when we are young, after school hours, 
                    every weekend. Soon, we started looking at ways to help the stray cats just 
                    around our neighbourhood. After a few months, we gathered like-minded people 
                    around Singapore to start an organisation called KaT. We hoped to give our cats 
                    a sense of belonging and a warm-hearted place for them to stay. <br><br>
