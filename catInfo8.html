                    <strong>Cat Info: </strong><br>
                    Gender: Male <br><br>
                    Date of Birth: 23th August 2020 <br><br>
                    Behaviour: Zap was abandoned by his owner after getting sick. 
                    However, this confident and brave cat doesn't let anything stop 
                    him. He is now perfectly fine although he is still on his daily 
                    medication. Zap wants nothing but a family to call his own. 
                    He is a very loyal and caring friend.
